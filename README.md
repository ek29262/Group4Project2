## Description of Dataset:

Our dataset was obtained from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/border-crossing-entry-data-683ae. It contains border entry data into the United States through land ports. It includes the borders that the United States shares with Canada and Mexico. The data is taken by the United States Customs and Border Protection. 

The dataset contains dimensions that capture the mode of transportation, the date of crossing (month, year), the volume on the date, the name of the port and the city the port belongs to. The data goes as far back as 1996 and as recent as January 2024.
