## Description of Dataset:

Our dataset was obtained from https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/border-crossing-entry-data-683ae. It contains border entry data into the United States through land ports. It includes the borders that the United States shares with Canada and Mexico. The data is taken by the United States Customs and Border Protection. 

The dataset contains dimensions that capture the mode of transportation, the date of crossing (month, year), the volume on the date, the name of the port and the city the port belongs to. The data goes as far back as 1996 and as recent as January 2024.


## Considerations:

There is considerable more border activity between the United States and Mexico. Because of this our group decided to focus our analysis around the United States and Mexican border.

Covid-19 heavily decreased the amount of border crossings. The border was closed for non-essential travel, and it took some months for the amount of border crossings to recover as restrictions loosened up. A sharp decline can be seen in April 2020 which marks the peak of Covid-19 in the United States.

## Question 1:

Are there any trends in border crossing based on time dependent factors, such as seasons, holidays, or other special calendar events?

This question can help dictate if their are any fluctations in border crossing volume based on time dependent factors. From the fluctations we can try to create some explanations. By anticipating an increase in border crossing volume Customs and Border Protection can prepare their resources to accomodate the amount of traffic coming in. This information can also help drive policy decisions and can be used to help determine the economic impact of border crossing activity.
